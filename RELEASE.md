# Releases

## v4.1.0

This version is a major update including many new functionalities and bugfixes.  
See Upgrade Manual (pdf) ([EN](https://github.com/apdn7/AnalysisPlatform/files/10728738/AP%2BDN7_upgrade_manual_En.pdf)/[JP](https://github.com/apdn7/AnalysisPlatform/files/10728739/AP%2BDN7_upgrade_manual_Jp.pdf)) if you are currently using the Analysis Platform v4.0.1 or v4.0.0.

Core changes

* Now uses batch file `start_ap.bat` to start the application.
  * Improved error tracing during the activation.
  * Automatically opens web browser and generate shortcuts.
  * Now shows "Port No./Language used/Path of application folder" on the title of the console screen. (Users those activate multiple applications can now distinguish the applications by looking at the title of the console screen)
  * See Getting Started (pdf) ([EN](https://github.com/apdn7/AnalysisPlatform/files/10728733/AP%2BDN7_getting_started_En.pdf)/[JP](https://github.com/apdn7/AnalysisPlatform/files/10728735/AP%2BDN7_getting_started_Jp.pdf)) for details.
* Default port number is changed to 7770.

New functionalities

* Data import
  * Added a function to read data which uses comma (,) as a decimal point.
  * Added a function to read data which uses commas and periods as thousands separators.
  * Added a function to read CSV/TSV file with no datetime column. Now automatically generates a dummy datetime column when it does not exist.
* Drawing Graphs
  * Functions such as on-demand filter/preprocessing/graph range adjustment/Facet division are deployed horizontally on each page.
  * Added a button to abort graph drawing.
  * Added a preprocessing function that automatically detects and removes sudden values with a large number of data in the surrounding area.
  * Added a function to save the setting information of the graph area, not only the setting area.
* DN7
  * (FPP) Added a function to display multiple switching lines at once from Label plot of Full Points Plot.
  * (MSP) Added a function to highlight in a heat map the order of correlation among the variables selected for the scatterplot matrix.
  * (StP) Added a function to stratify the character string data with a bar graph in the stratified plot.
  * (SkD) Added verification graphs of actual and predicted values, residual error plots, etc. to Sankey Diagram.

Minor changes and bugfixes
* Changed the specification to treat recurring decimals such as "3.3333" and "6.6666" as real numbers without automatically estimating them as exception values.
* A function that automatically adjusts the number of display digits for real numbers is also applied to each data point.
* Fixed a bug that caused an error when visualizing extremely small data and large data (e.g. e-10, e10)
* (MSP) Changed the logic to automatically adjust the threshold for the number of data to switch to high-speed mode in Multi Scatter Plot according to the number of selected variables
* (RLP) Fixed a bug of Facet/Div function in "Divide by category" mode of Ridge Line Plot
* (PCP) Fixed a bug where categorical data were not displayed correctly in Parallel Coordinates Plot
* (PCP) Fixed a bug that caused cast error when calculating correlation coefficients when integer items 
* (PCP) Fixed a bug that caused an error when calculating the correlation coefficient when there was an estimated value for inf/-inf in Parallel Coordinates Plot 
* (FPP) Fixed a bug where outliers disappeared when switching to full range in Full-points Plot
* \+ many other changes/bugfixes

## v4.0.1

This version fixes issues with the activation of the Analysis Platform.

* Fixed bug where Analysis Platform can not activate when changing the directory after initial activation
* Fixed bug in oss_start_app.bat where pip failed to install modules (caused when using pip 22.3)
